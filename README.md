# 📚 MongoDB-interview-Question: CRUD Operations, Queries & Data Modeling

This repository is designed to help **beginners to intermediate-level developers** learn and practice **MongoDB** through real-world examples and structured questions. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility, performance, and scalability. Understanding its features is essential for modern full-stack and backend development.

In this project, you will find:

- ✍️ Hands-on **MongoDB Shell commands** for learning how to manage databases and collections.
- 🔍 Practical examples of **query operators** including `$and`, `$or`, `$in`, `$gt`, `$lte`, and many more.
- ⚙️ A clear breakdown of **CRUD operations** – how to Create, Read, Update, and Delete documents in MongoDB.
- 🧠 Use of **projection** to retrieve only the fields you need.
- 🔢 **Counting**, **sorting**, **limiting**, and **skipping** documents to better control query results.
- 🛠️ Examples of **advanced update operations** using `$inc`, `$set`, `$unset`, etc.
- 🧹 How to **delete** documents, drop collections, and even entire databases.
- 🏗️ **Data modeling** examples to understand **one-to-many** and **many-to-many** relationships.
- 🔗 Explanation of when to use **embedded documents** vs **references**, and how to connect collections using `$lookup`.

- Optional: Mongoose (for `.populate()` in Node.js projects)

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mongodb-practice.git
   ```
2. Open `README.md` and practice each command in:
   - Mongo Shell (`mongosh`)
   - MongoDB Compass
   - Your own backend project using Node.js + Mongoose
3. You can also copy-paste the queries into a `.js` file to integrate with a Node.js project.
